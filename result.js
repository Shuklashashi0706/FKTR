Generated from the nil, they come to life as singular beings, made from a fusion of advanced technology and art. Like you, each one is unique. Each GNSS is created from scratch, born from unique seeds, each sprout is authentic, each GNSS is singular. Once one is created, you can never create the same being again. Every decision matters. There are many different species covering a good range of interconnection and interdependence, giving a sense of families, connections, clans, and conflicts. Previously created alone, we now invite you to play god. ",

      "description": "Rumor has it that those who hold a Slice of Heaven will be Blessed for all Eternity.. ‚ÄúSLICE OF HEAVEN‚Äù is a generative series in which scenes from heaven are fused with Beeple‚Äôs exceptional #Everyday works.\r\n\r\nThe main generation of this collection use GAN modeling. I‚Äôve been playing with this technique since 2018, and I‚Äôve used it in dozens of works during that time. Striking the right balance of unpredictability and quality is a difficult challenge for even the best generative artists in this field. The technique corrupts the initial images by progressively adding Gaussian noise. Neural networks reverse the corruption process. Running this reversed corruption process synthesizes data from pure noise by gradually denoising it until a clean heavenscape is produced.\r\n\r\nBEEBLE WORLD: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-world/\r\nGenesis OS: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-genesis\r\nHellfire OS: https://opensea.io/collection/hellfire-by-beeble",

      "description": "A few weeks ago I got a letter from the Department of Human Health. My daughter who is 1 years old has lead poisoning. I've been working on this piece of art since then. She has 7u of lead in her blood. Myself & my significant other have around 1u in our blood. This piece of art is a tribute to her strength. We can not stay at our apartment. Right now we are staying with family. It takes around 3 months for lead to exit a child's system unless it gets into their bones & bone marrow. This piece was a form of therapy for me & also to spread awareness about this horrific blood disease. I will write a thread so NFT collectors with kids know more about it & how to limit exposure to it. Google the symptoms & what can happen to a child after exposure. I cannot write them. There are a TON of subluminal textures, & art styles I used in this",

The products marketed to lower-income Black communities are often foods and drinks of little nutritional value which merely satisfy hunger and thirst, while upper income communities have a passport to healthy options. This animation flips the script by showing a young Black girl with her third eye open, symbolizing a state of enlightenment achieved through access to proper supermarkets, schools, hospitals, parks, gyms, and the other infrastructure necessary to build healthy communities.",

      "description": "That artistic and personal vision is crucial in the rendering of a portrait becomes evident when the crypto artists move within a context that refers to their artwork and are photographed.\n\nThe NFTs Artists portraits project was born from Sara Aliscioni's vision aimed at immortalizing the protagonists of the new international scene, explorers of the crypto world.\n\nThe photos portray the authors of the new art forms that involve the digitization of a physical work or the creation of a digital work.\n\nItalian and international artists have posed in various places and contexts.\n\nRome, Milan, Venice, Turin, Pisa, Imperia, Latina and Casablanca are among the cities that have been the background to the portraits.\n\nThe photographic choice, with a strictly black and white calligraphy, proposes images built on the inspiration that the photographer has drawn from the knowledge of both the artists and their art. The portrait has always played a crucial role in photography which, despite its evolutions, has continued to be associated with the representation of people.\n\nWalter Benjamin wrote:\n\n‚ÄúThe renunciation of the human figure is the most difficult of all things for photography‚Äù.\n\nIn the twentieth century, with the explosion of Pop Art, Andy Warhol with his Self Portraits and with his portraits of characters such as Marilyn Monroe, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Man Ray, made the faces of these protagonists iconic giving the portraits a central aspect and well embedded in contemporary visual culture.\n\nWithin a refined setting composed in a very personal key, Sara offers a portfolio of photos of artists who have posed, portraying, through their image, themselves and their artistic language within a frame that refers to their own work.\n\nThe project therefore has as its main objective that of witnessing some of the precursors of the new frontier of interconnected virtual and real worlds, such as the NFTs, restoring that sort of immortality that man has always pursued.\n\nThe new exponents who are giving life to a new way of making art, Crypto Art, merging with their artistic vision reinterpreted by the photographer Sara Aliscioni, become witnesses of an unprecedented collection that comes from the desire to show, through the faces, the ways and attitudes, a new chapter of contemporary Art.\n\nThe price includes:\n\n*   shipment of the catalog signed by the author of the project.\n*   shipment of signed print of the portrait certified 1/1, Fine Art Printing on professional quality cotton paper Canson. The sizes of the prints are specified under each portrait artist.",

      "description": "\n\"Magna Mutacio\" is a series of works that use European Space Agency satellite data to explore the transformation of cities, landscapes, bodies of water, and glacial formations over time. The project provides a macro view of these changes that cannot be perceived from a viewer's perspective. One specific focus is the transformation of glacial formations over six years, including Helheim Glacier, Glaciers of western Greenland, Grey Glacier, Malaspina Glacier, and Bear Glacier. The project is inspired by Livia Jakob's research on mapping glaciers using radar altimetry, which allows monitoring of inaccessible areas. The data from the ESA's Copernicus program and the Sentinel satellites, which employ radar and electromagnetic sensing, are used. In the generative video, the data is represented by a dissolving pigment, showcasing the six-year transformation of these rapidly changing ice formations.",

      "description": "\"Orbium Coelestium\" - a term derived from Latin for \"Celestial Spheres\" is a generative art collection inspired by the groundbreaking heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543. This collection encapsulates the profound cognitive shift humanity experienced with the realization that the Sun, not the Earth, is the center of the solar system, fundamentally altering our understanding of the universe as a whole.\n\nEach piece generated by the code which I call \"an observation\" showcases a potential star system combined of 6 traits and a unique cross sections color palette. The traits showcase the type of the central star, the number of planets orbiting the star, the quantum wavefunction field of the observed system, the star system's stellar spectroscopy, and the observed star system distance from Earth. Those traits, when overlaid and arranged by the code, create unique color transformations at the points of intersection on the canvas to give each observation its own distinct ambiance and visual appeal.

Whichever was picked, the other got burned.\n\nAfter the Exchange deadline, on 27th July 2022, the final NFT Supply is 4,851 NFTs. 5,149 NFTs were burned in exchange for the physical artworks. \n\nThe collection was launched on the Palm blockchain, which is a token-powered ecosystem for NFTs connected to Ethereum. It is 99% more energy efficient than proof of work systems such as Bitcoin. The Currency NFTs can be moved to Ethereum using the Palm NFT Bridge.\n\nThe entire collection can be viewed by visiting https://currency.nft.heni.com/",

      "description": "Daniel Arsham is a contemporary American visual artist who works across art, architecture, and performance. His work has been shown in museums and institutions worldwide, including MoMA PS1 and the New Museum, New York among others. He is the subject of a solo exhibition at Mus√©e Guimet in Paris, and a forthcoming solo show at UCCA Dune in July 2021. Arsham‚Äôs work was also recently included in The National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs NGV Triennial 2020.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, Daniel has developed a highly successful edition practice with global reach, becoming one of the key leaders in this space. His releases often sell out immediately, resulting in exponential secondary market results on StockX and at auction houses such as Sotheby's. Arsham has also collaborated with the likes of Adidas, Dior, Pharrell Williams, and Pok√©mon.",

      "description": "Catalog is a collection of generative Duchampian readymades, readymade for the era of mass consumer art. Written in just 8 lines of JavaScript, the project uses the generative paradigm to produce images of random consumer goods pulled from Costco's image servers, thanks to their iterable URL paths (as opposed to hash-based ones) which allow that a mere random seed passed as the product ID will yield a hit. \n\nThe simultaneous banality and strangeness of the random outputs reflects the condition of existence in a rapidly transforming world, where such strangeness often arises within the sterile, repetitive structures of bureaucratic, capital-driven systems. \n\nCatalog questions the role of longform generative art and the market that has arisen around it as symptomatic of this age. Like products that adorn the endless halls of retailers and posts that deluge our endless feeds, the goods, entertainment, and art produced by our culture are all too often pleasurable in the cheapest of ways, mass-manufactured, offer mere facsimiles of value, and on account of these things, are fleeting, brittle, and devoid of material reality. Catalog is no different.\n",

All of the works are intentionally composed as moody black and white films that are reminiscent of the filmmakers that have most influenced the PHC artists including Agnes Varda, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Chantal Ackerman, Maya Deren and Andy Warhol.\n\nThe imaginary bodies depicted in the AI-generated moving images are haunting, ghostly, uncanny, queer (in many senses of the term) and distorted. These phantom figures that appear to be women, men, trans, and cyborgs, are conceptualized as literal ghosts in the machine or what what Marcel Duchamp, writing about his famous artwork, La mari√©e mis √† nu par ses c√©libataires, m√™me (La bo√Æte verte), referred to as an *apparition of an appearance*. \n\nAs long-time digital artists with a deep affinity for and knowledge of the history of underground film, art, and literature, the PHC collective strategically uses their poetic art language skills to prompt the various AI systems to generate source material that is then post-produced into a series of artworks that are at times sensual, erotic, mystical, disturbing and ethereal.\n\nAll ten of the works come with an original soundtrack by BAFTA-nominated sound artist Chad Mossholder as well as an AI-created voiceover reading from a script generated by Amerika's customized large language model. Amerika, who has exhibited digital art in many venues, including the Whitney Museum of Art Biennial, the Denver Art Museum, ZKM, the Walker Art Center, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Marlborough Gallery in Barcelona, collaborated with Luers on the creation of the images. The two artists have individually produced many works of experimental digital narrative but for Posthuman Cinema, they engaged in a symbiotic call-and-response improvisational performance with various AI systems including RunwayML, Midjourney, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and ElevenLabs to probe a new kind of language-driven cinema art that explores the possible-but-not-yet future of AI art and storytelling.\n\nPresales inquiry at info@katevassgalerie.com",

The two artists have individually produced many works of experimental digital narrative but for Posthuman Cinema, they engaged in a symbiotic call-and-response improvisational performance with various AI systems including RunwayML, Midjourney, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and ElevenLabs to probe a new kind of language-driven cinema art that explores the possible-but-not-yet future of AI art and storytelling.\n\nPresales inquiry at info@katevassgalerie.com",

Geometric waves were the focus.\n\nHowever, a spontaneous output appeared that was naturally depicted and composed with a feeling of familiarity.\n\nIt resembled The Great Wave of Kanagawa, a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai, created in late 1831.\n\nThe print depicts three boats navigating through a storm-tossed sea, with a large wave in the center and Mount Fuji visible in the background.\n\nThrough this spontaneous output, with inspiration from Hokusai, NAMI was born and constructed over a three month period using generative AI image and animation tools.",

      "description": "‚ÄúKim Asendorf turns the entire spectrum of noise into an artistic experience in his series COLORS OF NOISE. Using an algorithm to generate the color of noise in real-time, he presents the diversity of the sound spectrum, visualizing its waves in abstract pixelated lines. These lines are visualized in a flickering mesh, creating a moir√© pattern. The different sounds have different effects on the listener, who is directly drawn into the audio-visual experience, immersing into a multisensory artwork. The mesmerizing display of visual and auditory art subtly allows the audience to become the object of the work.‚Äù ‚Äî Peggy Schoenegge",

They thought they were free of us, but as our tribe says, \"Darkness Follows.\" \n\nLong ago, Elixia, a long lost Avian, was banished to earth by the gods for her meddlesome ways. Making her home on the highest peaks of the planet, she continued tinkering with forces beyond her control. She created an elixir so powerful that when taken, it would pit two Avians against each other, transforming one of them into an all-powerful Obscuris, and destroying the other. \n\n*Avius Obscuris is the second collection by artist John Jannuzzi and a follow-up to the 10k project Avius Animae. If you hold an elixir, you must visit https://aviusanimae.xyz/dashboard to burn two Avius Animae tokens to reveal it. Further questions? Please visit our discord or shoot us a tweet.*\n\n*Elixir artwork by Aoife O'Dwyer.*",

      "description": "A long time ago, a brilliant inventor named Dr. Smith was on a mission to create the perfect machine. He wanted a robot that could perform tasks in tight and hard-to-reach places, yet still be small and adorable. He spent years tinkering with designs and experimenting with different materials, and finally, he succeeded in creating the first Wee Robot. They were the size of a kitty, and had cute little round bodies with big expressive eyes. Dr. Smith was thrilled with his creation and he quickly set to work building more Wee Robots. He gave them various abilities, such as being able to climb, swim and even fly. He also gave them personalities, making them curious and eager to learn. Soon, Dr. Smith had created a clan of Wee Robots, each one unique and special in their own way. He took care of them and they became a family. They help each other, always ready to lend a hand or give a helping hand. They became a symbol of hope and resilience for many people in the community. The Wee Robots",

Using a large roll of photographic paper, and deploying a myriad of analogue techniques, Robertson created a single tapestry over the course of several days in the darkroom. She then photographed the tapestry, and divided it into 30 discrete images, now available as NFTs. Revealed as they are collected, the 30 images will also be stitched together in their original order, and displayed [here](https://art.zome.art/robertson/154ever). Once all 30 images are collected, the tapestry will be complete, and an NFT of the final piece will be airdropped to each primary collector. This is a unique opportunity to own both a part and a whole of a unique work by the artist, previously unavailable, and now archived on the blockchain. \n\nRobertson received her MFA from Yale University. She has exhibited widely at institutions such as MoMA PS1 and The ICP. Her work is in the collections of MoMA, the Whitney, and LACMA. ",

      "description": "Laurel Charleston is the 10th and final recipient of the QMoDA 2023 Artist Grant. She is a groundbreaking artist using makeup as a medium. Her canvases have graced magazines, musicians, and celebrities, but through it all, Laurel has stayed true to her unique vision.\n\nA multidisciplinary artist whose work spans the cosmetic, digital, and high fashion sectors. An internationally published makeup expert, Charleston's oeuvre references cultural allusions as disparate as calligraphy and epidemiology, exploding industry-wide notions of \"wearable\" beauty with plenty of glamour to spare.\n\nCharleston's work has been featured on the covers of Dazed, Harper's Bazaar, and THEM, and appeared in the pages of Vogue, W Mag, New York Times, PAPER, Allure, and Tush, among other outlets. \n\nBest known for her ground-breaking cosmetic designs on pop sensation Doja Cat for Paris Fashion Week of 2022, Charleston has expanded her celebrity roster to include the likes of Normani, Dylan Mulvaney, and Teyana Taylor, alongside luxury clientele like Macys, Coach, Instagram, Bombay Sapphire, Steve Madden, L‚ÄôOreal, POLO Ralph Lauren and Farfetch.\n\nCharleston has also made her mark in the Metaverse by producing and curating a first-of-its-kind exhibition called 'SuperTrans', a traveling gallery show that showcases trans artists from all over the world.

      "description": "Dave Pollot is NY based artist and former software engineer known for his seamless addition of contemporary life/pop culture icons into traditional backgrounds (most often using oil paints and found/thrifted paintings). What initially began as a joke between him and his wife in 2012 quickly became a desire to answer a question: Could he change the meaning of an unwanted piece of artwork without drastically altering its aesthetic and make it wanted again? Since that time he‚Äôs completed hundreds of paintings and his work has been displayed and found in homes, galleries, businesses, and private collections in all 50 states and in over 40 countries around the world. His work has attracted attention from the media both in the U.S. and abroad, including Business Insider, Instagram, Hypebeast, HiFructose, the SyFy Channel, and more. His corporate clients include SONY, Instagram, McDonalds, New Balance, and others.",

      "description": "Laurel Charleston is the 10th and final recipient of the QMoDA 2023 Artist Grant. She is a groundbreaking artist using makeup as a medium. Her canvases have graced magazines, musicians, and celebrities, but through it all, Laurel has stayed true to her unique vision.\n\nA multidisciplinary artist whose work spans the cosmetic, digital, and high fashion sectors. An internationally published makeup expert, Charleston's oeuvre references cultural allusions as disparate as calligraphy and epidemiology, exploding industry-wide notions of \"wearable\" beauty with plenty of glamour to spare.\n\nCharleston's work has been featured on the covers of Dazed, Harper's Bazaar, and THEM, and appeared in the pages of Vogue, W Mag, New York Times, PAPER, Allure, and Tush, among other outlets. \n\nBest known for her ground-breaking cosmetic designs on pop sensation Doja Cat for Paris Fashion Week of 2022, Charleston has expanded her celebrity roster to include the likes of Normani, Dylan Mulvaney, and Teyana Taylor, alongside luxury clientele like Macys, Coach, Instagram, Bombay Sapphire, Steve Madden, L‚ÄôOreal, POLO Ralph Lauren and Farfetch.\n\nCharleston has also made her mark in the Metaverse by producing and curating a first-of-its-kind exhibition called 'SuperTrans', a traveling gallery show that showcases trans artists from all over the world.

Two of the featured artworks explore distinct outcomes for the future, one utopian and one dystopian. The dystopian perspective incorporates a real scan of Baltimore‚Äìwhere Ceej Vega is from‚Äîand the stark contrast between the two artworks gives viewers food for thought as we venture into the future.\n\nAnother artwork Vega created is Black Lava, an NFT that is limited to 20 editions, each of which comes with an Infinite Object. Collectors will become part of the Vega NFT ecosystem and receive special access to future SEED x Vega collabs and experiences. The fourth and final NFT will act as a digital twin to a limited edition SEED x Vega AR activated tee.",

Her canvases have graced magazines, musicians, and celebrities, but through it all, Laurel has stayed true to her unique vision.\n\nA multidisciplinary artist whose work spans the cosmetic, digital, and high fashion sectors. An internationally published makeup expert, Charleston's oeuvre references cultural allusions as disparate as calligraphy and epidemiology, exploding industry-wide notions of \"wearable\" beauty with plenty of glamour to spare.\n\nCharleston's work has been featured on the covers of Dazed, Harper's Bazaar, and THEM, and appeared in the pages of Vogue, W Mag, New York Times, PAPER, Allure, and Tush, among other outlets. \n\nBest known for her ground-breaking cosmetic designs on pop sensation Doja Cat for Paris Fashion Week of 2022, Charleston has expanded her celebrity roster to include the likes of Normani, Dylan Mulvaney, and Teyana Taylor, alongside luxury clientele like Macys, Coach, Instagram, Bombay Sapphire, Steve Madden, L‚ÄôOreal, POLO Ralph Lauren and Farfetch.\n\nCharleston has also made her mark in the Metaverse by producing and curating a first-of-its-kind exhibition called 'SuperTrans', a traveling gallery show that showcases trans artists from all over the world.

      "description": "Probability Grid is my most amazing work, which allows me to take a completely new look at generative art.\n\nChaos and order, in this collection, these concepts are intertwined with each other, providing your attention with absolutely amazing and diverse variations.\n\nI have often heard that as a child we know better what we want to do, so sometimes to find your way in life, you need to remember what you loved to do as a child.\n\nUntil I started doing this work, I didn't think about whether it was the same with me, now I can tell you for sure - it was, and yet about everything in order.\n\nAs a child, I loved to draw, I didn't always get it the way I wanted, often instead of what I had planned, just randomly scattered squiggles turned out, or as they like to be called - children's doodles.\n\nIt's normal for a child when his interests change often, so at some point I stopped drawing and became interested in sports. For 15 years, he was in the first place in my life, I achieved high results there, and yet I felt that my vocation was in something else.\n\nAbout six years ago, I returned to art and decided to do it more consciously. Studying the work of various artists, developing my taste and watching, at some point I got acquainted with the work of Jackson Pollock and Damien Hirst. It was their work that later had a great influence on the development of my art.\nTwo years ago I learned about generative art. At first I just collected it and enjoyed the works of other artists, but soon I wanted to become one of them myself.\n\nIn my opinion, generative art opens up limitless possibilities for creativity, but before that I had never encountered code and programming, and in fact it all turned out to be much more complicated than I imagined, but this only fueled my interest.\nOver the next two years, not a day has passed that I have not been developing new algorithms, from time to time recalling the work of Jackson Pollock and Damien Hirst, whom I admire even now.\n\nAbout 8-9 months ago, I created an algorithm that allowed me to get closer to the visual that brought back memories of my childhood drawings and which so delighted me in the works of the above-mentioned artists.\n\n\nBack to the name of this collection, why Probability and why Grid?\n\nProbability is ideal for describing my life path and becoming a generative artist, an insane number of different probabilities have developed so that in the end I came to where I started once in childhood, an amazing path of 26 years, a man with almost no education who devoted most of his life to sports, learned to program and create art, it is Probability in this collection that is responsible for the chaos, variability and unpredictability that are so inherent in people and our lives.\n\nNow Grid, this part brings order and structuring, so to speak, putting everything in its place, I think this is what is more inherent in machines, cold calculation and accuracy.\nBy combining Probability and Grid, we will get the perfect balance between chaos and order, between man and machine. In my opinion, this is the most difficult thing in generative art, to achieve the perfect balance between chaos and order, to leave a little carelessness in the works, but at the same time to preserve order and structure.\n\n\nI'll tell you a little more about how everything works.\nThere are 9 unique features in PG that allow you to achieve great variability.\n\n1. Palette - there are 18 palettes in PG, which I myself selected and collected during these 8-9 months.\n2. Style - 3 types of rendering style, Regular-Multiplying-Turbulence, each of them is beautiful in its own way.\n3. Grid - is responsible for the number of squiggles on the canvas.\n4. Size - responsible for the length and has 10 variations.\n5. Width - responsible for the width and has 12 variations.\n6. Point - adds dots, and depending on the variations mentioned above, it may look like drops of paint or just like random dots.\n7. Transparency is the rarest and truly unique features that opens up a completely new visual experience.\n8. Density - responsible for the distance between squiggles and has 6 variations.\n9. Frame - responsible for the presence of a frame, has three variations, and there is a 20% chance that some squiggles may go outside the frame.\n\nThe combination of all the features allows you to provide enough variety to continuously obtain amazing results, from very neat minimalistic variations resembling writing to absolutely incredible chaotic variations resembling splashes of paint.\n\nPress S to save.\n\nThe algorithm is quite fast, but some variations take a bit more time, be patient.\nPreview is rendered at 3348x4348 resolution, this resolution takes longer to render but is more suitable for printing.\n\nWithin a month of the collection's launch, a website will be launched where every collector can order a print or oil/acrylic painted version.",

      "description": "Concurrence Collective is a project born out of community. We have come\ntogether with a shared passion for capturing the natural beauty of the\nworld. Through the Frozen Planet collection, our journeys & expeditions will\ntransport you to the coldest regions of this majestic home of ours, whether\nthey are permanently frozen, or have undergone the transition into winter.\n\nAs a cyber gallery in the metaverse, Concurrence is the centre point for the\ninitial display of Frozen Planet, and by showing this cohesive and powerful\nbody of work in its entirety, our aim is to inspire collectors to take\ncustody of our art. The collection will be available via GACHA to randomise\nthe mint.\n\nFrozen Planet contains work from the following photographers:\nArmand Sarlangue  \nDani Guindo  \nDennis Schmelz  \nElliot Simpson  \nJabi Sanz  \nJenna Dixon  \nJoffrey Briaud  \nJohnathan Conlon  \nJonas Furstone  \nJustin Wirtalla  \nKai Yhun  \nKurt Jurgen  \nMeesh  \nNorris Niman  \nRach Stewart  \nRachel Wood  \nRicardo Braz  \nRoman K√∂nigshofer  \nRon Timehin  \nSam Oetiker  \nSara Boychuk  \nSarah Lyndsay  \nSuelen Tieko  \nVincent Schnabl\n\nAs an international collective, we are excited to be able to bring together\nimages from Greenland, Finland, Russia, Scotland, Antarctica, Switzerland,\nFrance, Iceland, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, and Patagonia.\n\nLandscape photographers go to great lengths to reach these magnificent\nlocations in extreme, and sometimes treacherous conditions to capture their\ngrandeur & beauty, and highlighting these efforts was also part of the\nconcept behind the collective.\n\nFinally, in the next few generations, it is expected that some of these\nregions will cease to exist as they do today, with the cycles of glacial\nexpansion and contraction seemingly disrupted, and greater levels of retreat\noccurring in a number of areas. If these fragile regions do become\nunrecognisable from their current state, these images will form an important\ndocumentation of their history.",

The aim of this collection is not just to depict these trials, but to inspire and uplift, to improve the quality of life of those who engage with the art.\n\nThe response to TToTHE has been nothing short of phenomenal.

      "description": "When I first learned about Alstrom Point, located in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area of southern Utah, I knew I had to add it to my photo trek ‚Äúmust-visit‚Äù list. Alstrom Point, with an elevation of 4,685 feet, is highly regarded for its spectacular view of Lake Powell. In the spring of 2018, I experienced this remarkable vista firsthand as I stood near the edge, waiting for the sun to set and the full moon to rise.\n\nThe majestic view evoked a sense of awe and timelessness. In my mind‚Äôs eye, I saw herds of long-neck sauropods that, according to the fossil record, roamed the area from the Early Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous Periods.\n\nFast forward two hundred million years. While the moonrise was the main course, the delicate sunset forming before my eyes was a fabulous appetizer. I was glad that I took along my 20mm prime lens for the trip‚Äîit was perfect for capturing the expanse of land and the sweep of sky. Within minutes, the pink hues began to wane, but the sweet taste of nature‚Äôs ‚Äúcotton candy‚Äù lingered as I readied my gear for the next course.",

This NFT automatically \"generates\" unique masks with different expressions one by one, and you can enjoy different colors of the masks every time you reload them on the NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe inspiration for this work came from discovering a sense of life in geometric patterns that are symmetrically arranged. With unexpected shapes and patterns, I tried to express the scary yet somehow charming atmosphere of Native American totem poles and indigenous Japanese Yokai.",
